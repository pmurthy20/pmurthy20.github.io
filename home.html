                <h1>Hi! My name is Prathik Murthy</h1>
                <p>I'm a freshman studying at Michigan State University seeking a B.S. in Computer Science. I've spent my entire life deeply interested in programming, computers, and software development as a whole. </p>
                <p>I have a widely varied and ever-expanding skillset, encompassing multiple programming languages, computer-aided design / manufacturing (CAD/CAM), large scale leadership and project management, and much more.</p>
                <p>I am currently seeking an internship as a software developer or engineer, with the goal of expanding the breadth of my knowledge and gaining essential workplace experience.</p>
                <p>This website was created entirely from scratch, more information and links to the code can be found under the "Portfolio" section.</p>
