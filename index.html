                <div class="text-p-1">I'm an undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science from Michigan State University. I have a drive to learn and explore as much as I can about software development, leading to my ever-expanding skillset in a wide variety of relevant skills. It's my dream to one day create, develop, and implement technologies that stimulate positive change in the world.</div>
                <div class="text">I have spent years learning multiple languages, frameworks, and platforms, leading to experience in Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, among others. My varied collection of extra-curriculars gave me the opportunity to become proficient in Computer Aided Design / Manufacturing (CAD/CAM), manual and CNC machine operation, leadership, and project management.</div>
                <div class="text">I am currently seeking an internship or research opportunity to observe and directly participate in emerging and ongoing development happening today. This website serves as a portfolio for my resume, along with my completed projects to showcase my skills. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me.</div>
